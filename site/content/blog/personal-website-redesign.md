In 2017, I decided to redesign my personal website. I thought it would be a quick and easy job. It ended up taking me two years to finish. In this blog post, I want to share my journey and the things I learned redesigning and rebuilding my own personal website.

I created my first personal website in 2014. I wanted to have my own space on the internet to experiment, learn and share. But my life got super busy and I never got around to it. After spending almost three years in Thailand on my own helping to build start-ups, working freelance for large corporations, and coming back to Canada, I realized it was time to put all the things I’ve learned to build something for myself. And so the journey began.

## The First Step

When I got started as a web developer, I knew nothing about design. But over the years, I’ve learned a lot from collaborating with many great designers and picked up a thing or two. A good place to start when designing a website is to think about brand identity. More than just choosing your favorite color, good branding gets at the essence of who you are. For myself, I love the fact that the web is a platform where science and art intersect. I wanted to capture that beautiful interplay of design and code in my brand.

I thought back to the most basic constructs of computer – bits and signals. It is still quite amazing to me that bits of 0s and 1s woven through electrical signals could reshape the world. Bits and signals. The primal engines of the modern world. A grand idea for an ambitious theme.

Next was color. I really wanted to say I chose an orange hue because I was inspired by the color of the sun – the ultimate source of energy that permeates all things. It is the color of rising dawn and falling dusk – signaling the change from darkness to light and light to darkness. Zero to one, one to zero. How poetic. But the truth is, I really chose it because I liked the color – a true artist needs no reason to love.

And so with these concepts in mind, I started playing around with different logo designs. I wanted a logo that can be used throughout the website in different functions. After a lot of experimentations I ended up with the following logo concept:

I decided to use rectangles to represent discrete signals. I then compose them in different ways to generate more meaningful designs. I started with the first logo on the top left. It is a signal in the shape of a letter W. My first initial and my logo. It is easy once I laid down the core ideas to expand on it.

Since my first name is in Thai and it’s hard for a lot of people to pronounce, I also go by the name Will. An idea took shape in my head to transform the letter W to the name Will. That thought gave birth to the second logo. If you hover over my name in the navigation bar you can see how Will is constructed from W. It was quite fun to build so if time permits, I might get around to write about the implementation details in a future post.

Aside from the first two designs, I also made multiple other designs based on the same concept that ended up being used as visual cues throughout the site.

## Conclusion
Great designs can be deceptively simple. Having gone through the branding process from ideation to execution, I gained a lot of appreciation for how great brands are made. For personal branding projects, I believe you have to start by understanding who you are, what you care about and how you want to express yourself. Everyone has their own personal journey that lead them to where they are. We all have stories to tell. And this is where my story begins.
